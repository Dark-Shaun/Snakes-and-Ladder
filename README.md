# Snakes-and-Ladder
Following is code for Snakes and Ladder Game using a random package present in Python.

1.The code consists two player functions Player1 and Player2.

2.The rules of game are same as Snakes and Ladder only the idea to start the game when dice rolls out '1' is being avoided.The games starts with any number being rolled first i.e. if the first rolled out  number 3 then the game will start.

3.Major work of random function in this code is same as that of a dice i.e. to genrate a random number as a rolled out number.
 
4.The idea to use 'i' is just to introduce truns one after other i.e. when we use i=1 the Player 1 will play and i=2 Player 2 will have his turn.
